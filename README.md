#### [Course Schedule](schedule.md) and [Course wiki]https://github.com/rebleo/webPrdctnSpring2022/wiki)


#### Course Description:
This course is an introduction to viewer (client) side programming. The semester is scheduled in sequence to enable incremental understanding and application of best practices for authoring the web. This course will provide a basic understanding of the methods and techniques of developing a simple to moderately complex front end site. Students will create and maintain websites that take into consideration aesthetic quality, user experience and technical expertise. Participants will explore granular techniques for design and programming using: HTML5, CSS3, EcmaScript6 and various external libraries.

#### IDM Program Learning Objectives:
Students will:
1. develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.

2. develop technical skills to realize their ideas.

3. develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic + technological contexts.

4. gain knowledge of professional practices and organizations by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking + career preparation.

5. develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

#### Course Objectives:
* Web Development Workflow Including a local HTTP Server
* Unix Bash (vsh) shell 
* User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX)
* HTML5 / CSS3
* The Responsive Web (flexible media & media queries)
* EcmaScript 6 (JavaScript)
* CSS + Javascript Libraries: Bootstrap, JQuery, etc.

#### Student Learning Outcomes:
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
1. Design, build, and develop content for a professional - quality websites
2. Learn the git and Github workflows while using Github Pages to publish and maintain our sites.
3. Understand + implement the iterative process - including maintaining + adding to an existing site
4. Learn how to proactively learn + use the web to research open source tools + documentation
5. Create an internal developer / creative community

#### Course Structure:
Class time will be spent as a combination of lecture, discussion, in class exercises, group work, critique + student presentations. Homework will consist of weekly projects that ask students to respond to readings, thinking critically about the cultural implications of networked technologies while building on each week’s technical material. After week three - **students should will build and publish a new web page every week using Github Pages** in response to the technical and conceptual material.

#### Required Materials:
* Students will need a laptop for class (if this is an issue, please come talk to me)
* Text editing software - VCS, Atom, Sublime
* Web Browser: Chrome or Firefox
* [Unix Bash shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))- Mac Terminal or Windows Bash Power Shell
* A Github Account + Git

#### Research + Resources (or the class repo):
All materials for this class are open source + can be accessed via the web. Regular updates to the class repo will contain starter code gone over during class as well as links to further technical reading (or watching). There will likely be more resources than you could possibly research + implement each week. The idea is to point students to a wide array of resources with an emphasis on the most modern toolkits + most up-to-date and concise online documentation. Pick and choose what is of most interest to you - the repo is a jumping off point for your own research + you can always return back to a week to catch up on missed material. Later in the semester students will be responsible for citing + discussing their research methods and discoveries with the class.  

#### “Share” (or the class wiki):
The class wiki - is where the rest of the syllabus including in-class and homework assignments will be found. To turn in your homework you should add a link to your work weekly using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). You are required to post on the wiki. To contribute to the wiki you must set up a [Github](http://www.github.com) account.

#### Readings:
Readings will be assigned weekly and can be accessed from the class wiki.

#### Grading + Attendance Policy:
Class Participation (30% of grade): Please arrive on time having completed the assignments. Participation in class discussions and peer feedback are not only expected, but will be reflected in your grade.

Weekly Design + Technical Exercises + Class Site + Presentations (40% of grade): will be executed through the semester by following in class demonstrations, online tutorials and assigned readings. These exercises will be essential for learning markup and coding and to successfully complete more complex projects.

Students will be expected to document their work, write reading and personal reflections on a website built for + during class using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). We will build this site together incrementally during the first few weeks, following assignments + projects are to be added + linked to throughout the semester. It is mandatory that you use git via the command line to push / publish your sites. **You will lose points on any assignment that is not hosted on Github pages.**

Final Project (30% of grade)
Class will culminate with final projects. It is expected that these will be both technology and content driven. The final project will be built over the course of several weeks. This project must be completed, published + presented in class.
